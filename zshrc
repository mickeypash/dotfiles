# Less config
  # i - Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.
    # This option is ignored if any uppercase letters appear in the search pattern; in other words, if  a  pattern contains uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore case.
  # M - Causes less to prompt even more verbosely than more.
  # F - Scroll  forward,  and keep trying to read when the end of file is reached.
    # Normally this command would be used when already at the end of the file.  It is a way to monitor the tail of a file which is growing while it is being viewed.
    # (The behavior is similar to the "tail -f" command.)
  # X - Disables  sending  the  termcap  initialization  and deinitialization strings to the terminal.
    # This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization string does something unnecessary, like clearing the screen.
  # S - Causes  lines  longer  than  the screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped.
    # That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in the screen width is not shown.
    # The default is to wrap long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.
  # x4 - Sets tab stops.  If only one n is specified, tab stops are set at multiples of n.
    # If multiple values separated by commas are specified, tab stops are set at those positions, and  then  continue  with the same spacing as the last two.
    # For example, -x9,17 will set tabs at positions 9, 17, 25, 33, etc.  The default for n is 8.
  # R - Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.
    # Useful if the file is changing while it is being viewed.
